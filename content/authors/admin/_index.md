I'm a postdoc at the Chair of Enterprise Systems, University of Mannheim, Germany. I received my PhD in information systems from the University of Mannheim. I previously worked as a business data analyst at zeroG, a subsidiary of Lufthansa Systems, specializing in data science and digital transformation. My work has appeared in Journal of the Association for Information Systems, Government Information Quarterly, and the Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Systems.
